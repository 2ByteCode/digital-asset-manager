Visibility options enable/disable the single and archive pages. If you want to store the asset for your agency's internal purpose, keep the visibility of asset post type and asset type taxonomy private.

No, currently this feature is not included. But we are working on it and it will be available in the next release. Your theme default single and archive page templates will be used to render the content if you have set the visibility to the public.
